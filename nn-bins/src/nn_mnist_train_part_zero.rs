    // Why hidden nodes is 100?
    // Because there is not scientific way to determine the number of hidden nodes, we think neural network should find some patterns in the input data, 
    // these patterns can be represented by the hidden nodes with shorter length., so we did not choose number which is larger than 28*2. That can force
    // neural network to find some patterns in the input data. But if you choose a number which is too small, neural network will not find some patterns
    // you must konw that there is no best way to determine the number of hidden nodes. The better way is to try different numbers and find the best one.

    // Why output nodes is 10?
    // Because there are 10 digits(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) in the MNIST dataset, so we choose 10 as the output nodes.
